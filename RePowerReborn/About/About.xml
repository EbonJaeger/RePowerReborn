  <description> &lt;color=orange&gt;&lt;b&gt;Important: &lt;/b&gt; This mod requires HubsLib to be loaded before it in the load order.&lt;/color&gt;

    Rebalance power consumption based on when an object is in use.

    Generally speaking, power consumers will use substantially reduced power when not in use, and substantively more power when in use. Power consumption will accordingly vary wildly based on usage, rather than the vanilla behaviour of simply how many worktables or doors you have.

    Effected Buildings:
    Electric Tailoring Bench (10W Idle, 500W Active)
    Electric Smithy (10W Idle, 1000W Active)
    Machining Table (10W Idle, 1400W Active)
    Electric Stove (10W Idle, 1000W Active)
    Electric Smelter (400W Idle, 4500W Active)
    Biofuel Refinery (10W Idle, 1800W Active)
    Fabrication Bench (10W Idle, 1800W Active)
    Electric Crematorium (200W Idle, 750W Active)

    Multi-Analyzer (10W Idle, 600W Active) (Active when an associated research table is in use)
    Vitals Monitor (10W Idle, 1000W Active) (Active when the associated medical bed is in use)
    HiTech Research Bench (100W Idle, 1000W Active)
    AutoDoor (5W Idle, 500W Active) (Active when open, but not blocked or held)

    Televisions (10W Idle, 400W Active) (Active when being watched)

    Deep Drill (10W Idle, 500W Active)
    Hydroponics Basin (10W Idle, 75W Active) (Active when something is planted in it)
