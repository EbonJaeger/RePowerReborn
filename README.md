# RePowerReborn
Rebalance power consumption based on when an object is in use.  
Original mod by Texel, updated to RimWorld 1.0 by NubsPixel, now continued by me (EbonJaeger).

Generally speaking, power consumers will use substantially reduced power when not in use, and substantially more power when in use. Power consumption will accordingly vary wildly based on usage, rather than the vanilla behaviour of simply how many worktables or doors you have.
